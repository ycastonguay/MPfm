Project File Synchronization Tool
(C) 2013 Yanick Castonguay            

This tool synchronizes Visual Studio/MonoDevelop project files. It works by watching changes in all project files listed in a solution. It then synchronizes file additions/deletion between project files located in the same directory. You can use this tool to synchronize class library project files between .NET/Mono/MonoTouch/Mono for Android projects.

It is compatible with Windows, Linux and OS X.
