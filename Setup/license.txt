=================================================
3.0 - Other License Information
=================================================

Here is more important information about the MPfm license:

-------------------------------------------------
3.1 - MP3
-------------------------------------------------
Technicolor (formely Thompson Multimedia) is the current owner of the MP3 patents and are selling licenses for MP3 products. All MP3 software decoders must pay a minimum license fee of $15,000 USD per year and $0.75 per unit (see this page: http://www.mp3licensing.com/royalty/).

Technicolor are not making it very obvious on their website, but they say they will not charge a per unit royalty on freely distributed Windows MP3 decoders, such as Foobar2000 (see this page: http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Thomson-Keine-Lizenzgebuehren-fuer-freie-MP3-Decoder-58503.html). Microsoft Windows comes with a built-in MP3 decoder that is licensed to Technicolor with every copy of Windows.

MPfm can decode MP3 files but cannot encode MP3 files. MPfm is a free open-source application, mp4m.org is free of ads, so we believe MPfm does not apply to MP3 decode royalty rates.

Important: If MPfm is used in a commercial environment, other MP3 royalty rates might apply to your situation. Please consult this page for more information: http://www.mp3licensing.com/royalty/.

3.2 - Background Images
-------------------------------------------------
The background images used on mp4m.org, on the MPfm splash screen and in the MPfm setup were taken from stock.xchng (http://www.sxc.hu/). Please consult their license for more information at http://www.sxc.hu/help/7_2.
