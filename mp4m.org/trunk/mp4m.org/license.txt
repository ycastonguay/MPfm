=================================================
3.0 - Other License Information
=================================================

Here is more important information about the MPfm license:

-------------------------------------------------
3.1 - MP3
-------------------------------------------------

Officially, all applications decoding MP3 files must pay a license to the MP3 copyright owner, Technicolor (http://www.mp3licensing.com/). However, this distribution of MPfm is released under the GPLv3 license and is available free of charge. The MPfm source code is available for anyone to download on SourceForge.Net. This means its copyright owner is not making money with this product.

Microsoft Windows also comes with a built-in MP3 decoder, and Microsoft is paying the license for all Windows copies. Thus, Technicolor does not enforce the patent for Windows freeware MP3 decoders such as MPfm (and other freeware players such as Foobar2k).

A declaration from Thomson (acquired later by Technicolor) says that they will not charge a per unit royalty on freely distributed MP3 decoders. This declaration can be found here: http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Thomson-Keine-Lizenzgebuehren-fuer-freie-MP3-Decoder-58503.html.

However, if you wish to release a commercial product using the MPfm source code, you are *REQUIRED* to contact Technicolor to pay the due royalties. The MPfm copyright owner is *NOT RESPONSIBLE* for any royalties involving audio file formats.

More information about MP3 licensing can be found at http://www.mp3licensing.com/.

3.2 - Background Images
-------------------------------------------------
