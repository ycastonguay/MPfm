=================================================
3.0 - Other License Information
=================================================

Here is more important information about the MPfm license:

-------------------------------------------------
3.1 - MP3
-------------------------------------------------
There currently is a gray area about MP3 licensing, depending on the country where you live in. Officially, all applications enabling MP3 decoding must pay a license to the MP3 copyright owner, Technicolor (http://www.mp3licensing.com/). This license is minimum $15,000 USD per year. However, MPfm is freeware and open source, which means it will always stay free and no profit will be made from any activity related to the application. Microsoft Windows already comes with a MP3 decoder built-in, and Microsoft has paid the license for all Windows copies. Thus, Technicolor does not enforce the patent for Windows freeware MP3 decoders such as MPfm (and other freeware players such as Foobar2k).

A declaration from Thomson (older name for Technicolor) says that they will not charge a per unit royalty on freely distributed MP3 decoders. This declaration can be found here: http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Thomson-Keine-Lizenzgebuehren-fuer-freie-MP3-Decoder-58503.html.

3.2 - Background Images
-------------------------------------------------
