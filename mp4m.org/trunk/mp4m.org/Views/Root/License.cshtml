<h3><a name="3.0">3.0 Other License Information</a></h3>
<p>
    Here is more important information about the MPfm license:
</p>
<h4><a name="3.1">3.1 MP3</a></h4>
<p>
    Officially, all applications decoding MP3 files must pay a license to the MP3 copyright owner, 
    <a href="http://www.mp3licensing.com/" title="MP3 Licensing Homepage">Technicolor</a>. However, this distribution of MPfm is released under 
    the GPLv3 license and is available free of charge. The MPfm source code is available for anyone to download on SourceForge.Net. This 
    means its copyright owner is not making money with this product.
</p>
<p>
    Microsoft Windows also comes with a built-in MP3 decoder, and Microsoft is paying the license for all Windows copies. 
    Thus, Technicolor does not enforce the patent for Windows freeware MP3 decoders such as MPfm (and other freeware players such as Foobar2k).
</p>
<p>
    A declaration from Thomson (older name for Technicolor) says that they will not charge a per unit royalty on freely distributed MP3 
    decoders. This declaration can be found 
    <a href="http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Thomson-Keine-Lizenzgebuehren-fuer-freie-MP3-Decoder-58503.html" title="Freeware MP3 Decoder Declaration">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
    However, if you wish to release a commercial product using the MPfm source code, you are <b>*REQUIRED*</b> to contact Technicolor to 
    pay the due royalties. The MPfm copyright owner is <b>*NOT RESPONSIBLE*</b> for any royalties involving audio file formats for commercial use of this source code.
