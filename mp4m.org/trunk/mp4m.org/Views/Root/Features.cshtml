<h2>Features</h2>
<h3>At A Glance</h3>
<p>
    MPfm has a lot of common features with other music players, such as <b>gapless playback</b>, support for most popular sound formats, 
    tagging, etc.
    However, it also has a lot of unique features that most musicians will enjoy. Here are some of the most powerful features of MPfm:
</p>
<ul class="code">
    <li><b>Filter Library by Sound Format</b><br />
    Most audio players support a wide variety of sound formats (see list below). However, none let you filter your library
    by sound format as easily as MPfm; just use the "Filter by Sound Format" combo box.
    </li>
    <li><b>Time Shifting</b><br />
    Picking up complex rythmic sections by ear is much easier when you use time shifting. You can slow down or speed up 
    audio streams from 50% up to 150%.
    </li>
    <li><b>Loops</b><br />
    You are practicing a hard solo on your guitar and you can't make it to the end of the bridge? With MPfm, you can create
    loops to practice specific parts of your songs. That way, you can stay on your instrument instead of reaching for the mouse
    every minute!
    </li>
    <li><b>Markers</b><br />
    You can create markers that can used for looping sections in a song for practice.
    </li>
</ul>
