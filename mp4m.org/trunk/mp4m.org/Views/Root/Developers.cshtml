</p>
<p>

    For more information, check the <a href="/license" title="MPfm License">MPfm license</a>.
</p>
<h3>MPfm Components</h3>
<p>
    You are also allowed to use the MPfm components in your project if you wish. This means you don't have to release the source code of 
    your application; you must only release the modified MPfm components source code. The MPfm components include the player, library, custom controls, and more.
    MPfm components require the <b>.NET Framework 4.0</b>.
</p>
<p>    
    To add a MPfm component to your project, download the source code package, and add a reference to the following assemblies in your project 
    (depending on what you want to use):
</p> 
<ul class="code">       
    <li><b>MPfm.Core</b><br />
        Useful methods for all kinds of projects.
    </li>
    <li><b>MPfm.Sound</b><br />
        Bass.NET wrapper, TagLib# wrapper, AudioTools class for calculating audio data, PeakFile class for peak file reading/writing, TestDevice class to test audio devices, etc.
    </li>    
    <li><b>MPfm.Player</b><br />
        Player classes with all their dependencies.
    </li>
    <li><b>MPfm.Library</b><br />
        Library classes with all their dependencies.
    </li>
    <li><b>MPfm.WindowsControls</b><br />
        Custom Windows Forms controls such as Label, LinkLabel, Button, Panel, ScrollBar, SongGridView, WaveFormDisplay, etc.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Alternatively, you can also add the MPfm components to your project by adding a reference to the <b>MPfm NuGet packages</b>, which will be available soon.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Note</b>: You can find a <b>demo application</b> of the Player component in the PlaybackEngineV4 folder of the Source Code package. The demo application
    has the same features as MPfm, without the eye candy! This makes it easier to learn the Player component and use it in your own project. You can also read
    the <b>.CHM help file</b> inside the source code package.
</p>
<h3>BASS.NET Key</h3>
<p>
    In order to use the BASS.NET audio library in your own project, you will require to register a key from the 
    <a href="http://bass.radio42.com/index.html" title="BASS.NET Web Site">BASS.NET web site</a>. 
    You are forbidden to release any source code with a BASS.NET key. This is why the MPfm source code package does not ship with a valid
    BASS.NET key, but the binary package does.
</p>
<h3>Releasing an Application Using MPfm Components</h3>
<p>
    You <b>must</b> repackage the MPfm license including all its dependencies with your application, and add the copyright notices as stated in the
    <a href="/license" title="MPfm License">MPfm license</a>. You <b>must</b> release any modified MPfm source code with your application.
</p>
